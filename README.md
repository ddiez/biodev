# biodev

Dockerfile for creating a custom Bioinformatics development environment including:

* R, Bioconductor and other R packages.
* MACS

## History

The github/dockerhub repository was previously named docker_bioc_3.4 because my original intention was to make a reproducible R environment including the Bioconductor packages I use from my projects. Then, I decided to make it an all-(my)-purpose development environment for Bioinformatics projects.

In my workstation I usually mount the file system containing all the important data *biodev*. Hence, this project was renamed to reflect that parallelism.
